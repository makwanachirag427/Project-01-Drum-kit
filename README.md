This is my implementation of the JavaScript30 Day 1 project, a virtual drum kit. When you press specific keys on your keyboard, it will play the corresponding drum sound and display a visual effect on the screen.

I completed this project as a part of the JavaScript30 coding challenge, which involves building 30 different projects in 30 days to improve my JavaScript skills.
